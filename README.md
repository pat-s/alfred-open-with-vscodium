# alfred-open-with-vscodium

Open a directory in VSCodium with Alfred

## Usage

1. Download the [.alfredworkflow]()
2. In Alfred type:

    ```bash
    cd <folder-name>
    ```

   - &#x23ce; (`return`) to open with VSCodium
   - &#x2325; (`option`) + &#x23ce; (`return`) to open in Finder

## Keybinding

Why `cd`? Because `codium` is too long.
Feel free to adjust it to your needs in the Alfred workflow :)
